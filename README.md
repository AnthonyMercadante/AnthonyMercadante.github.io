# Anthony Mercadante's Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This website showcases my projects, skills, and professional journey. It's built using TypeScript and React, and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Structure

- `backup (old site)/`: Contains the old version of the site for archival purposes.
- `src/`: The source code of the new React-based website.
- `public/`: Public assets and the entry HTML file.
