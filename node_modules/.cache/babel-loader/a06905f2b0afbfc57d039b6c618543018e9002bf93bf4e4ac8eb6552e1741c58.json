We managed to create a virtual Open Flow Water Machine that not only saved space but also enhanced the learning experience for students. It was a testament to the power of VR in education and the potential of Unity as a tool for creating complex simulations.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n\r\n        <Typography variant=\"body1\" gutterBottom>\r\n          This project at Mohawk College was more than just a co-op placement task; it was a journey that honed my skills in simulation, VR, and programming. It underscored the importance of practical application in learning and the endless possibilities that technology offers in transforming education.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n      </Box>\r\n    </Box>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default OpenFlowMachinePortfolio;\r\n"],"mappings":";;AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,SAASC,GAAG,EAAEC,UAAU,EAAEC,aAAa,EAAEC,QAAQ,QAAQ,eAAe;AACxE,OAAOC,KAAK,MAAM,yCAAyC;AAC3D,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,6CAA6C;AAChE,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,qCAAqC;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAEzD,MAAMC,wBAAwB,GAAGA,CAAA,KAAM;EAAAC,EAAA;EACrC,MAAMC,KAAK,GAAGR,QAAQ,CAAC,CAAC;EACxB,MAAMS,QAAQ,GAAGV,aAAa,CAACS,KAAK,CAACE,WAAW,CAACC,IAAI,CAAC,IAAI,CAAC,CAAC;EAE5D,MAAMC,UAAU,GAAGH,QAAQ,GACzB;IAAEI,KAAK,EAAE,MAAM;IAAEC,MAAM,EAAE,MAAM;IAAEC,SAAS,EAAE;EAAO,CAAC,GACpD;IAAEC,QAAQ,EAAE,KAAK;IAAEF,MAAM,EAAE,MAAM;IAAEC,SAAS,EAAE,MAAM;IAAEE,OAAO,EAAE,OAAO;IAAEC,UAAU,EAAE,MAAM;IAAEC,WAAW,EAAE;EAAO,CAAC;EAEnH,oBACEd,OAAA,CAACR,GAAG;IAACuB,EAAE,EAAE;MAAEC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC;MAAEC,OAAO,EAAE,oBAAoB;MAAEC,KAAK,EAAE,cAAc;MAAEC,CAAC,EAAE,CAAC;MAAEP,OAAO,EAAE,MAAM;MAAEQ,aAAa,EAAE,QAAQ;MAAEC,UAAU,EAAE;IAAS,CAAE;IAAAC,QAAA,eACnJtB,OAAA,CAACR,GAAG;MAACuB,EAAE,EAAE;QAAEP,KAAK,EAAEJ,QAAQ,GAAG,MAAM,GAAG,KAAK;QAAEmB,SAAS,EAAE;MAAS,CAAE;MAAAD,QAAA,gBACjEtB,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,IAAI;QAACC,YAAY;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEtC;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eAEb7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,IAAI;QAACC,YAAY;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEtC;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eACb7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,OAAO;QAACC,YAAY;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEzC;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eAEb7B,OAAA;QAAK8B,GAAG,EAAElC,KAAM;QAACmC,GAAG,EAAC,sDAAsD;QAACC,KAAK,EAAEzB;MAAW;QAAAmB,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eACjG7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,SAAS;QAAAF,QAAA,EAAC;MAAoD;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eAE/F7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,IAAI;QAACC,YAAY;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEtC;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eACb7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,OAAO;QAACC,YAAY;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEzC;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eAEb7B,OAAA;QAAK8B,GAAG,EAAEjC,MAAO;QAACkC,GAAG,EAAC,8BAA8B;QAACC,KAAK,EAAEzB;MAAW;QAAAmB,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eAC1E7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,SAAS;QAAAF,QAAA,EAAC;MAA4B;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eAEvE7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,IAAI;QAACC,YAAY;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEtC;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eACb7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,OAAO;QAACC,YAAY;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEzC;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eAEb7B,OAAA,CAACR,GAAG;QAACuB,EAAE,EAAE;UAAEkB,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;UAAEzB,KAAK,EAAE,MAAM;UAAEG,QAAQ,EAAE,GAAG;UAAEF,MAAM,EAAE;QAAO,CAAE;QAAAa,QAAA,eAC/DtB,OAAA;UACEQ,KAAK,EAAC,MAAM;UACZC,MAAM,EAAC,KAAK;UACZqB,GAAG,EAAC,2CAA2C;UAC/CI,KAAK,EAAC,sBAAsB;UAC5BC,WAAW,EAAC,GAAG;UACfC,KAAK,EAAC,0FAA0F;UAChGC,eAAe;QAAA;UAAAX,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACR;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACP,CAAC,eAEN7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,IAAI;QAACC,YAAY;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEtC;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eACb7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,OAAO;QAACC,YAAY;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEzC;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eAEb7B,OAAA;QAAK8B,GAAG,EAAEhC,MAAO;QAACiC,GAAG,EAAC,mDAAmD;QAACC,KAAK,EAAEzB;MAAW;QAAAmB,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eAC/F7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,SAAS;QAAAF,QAAA,EAAC;MAAiD;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eAE5F7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,OAAO;QAACC,YAAY;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEzC;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eAEb7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,IAAI;QAACC,YAAY;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEtC;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eACb7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,OAAO;QAACC,YAAY;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEzC;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eAEb7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,IAAI;QAACC,YAAY;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEtC;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eACb7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,OAAO;QAACC,YAAY;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEzC;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eAEb7B,OAAA,CAACP,UAAU;QAAC+B,OAAO,EAAC,OAAO;QAACC,YAAY;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEzC;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACV;EAAC;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACH,CAAC;AAEV,CAAC;AAAC3B,EAAA,CAxFID,wBAAwB;EAAA,QACdN,QAAQ,EACLD,aAAa;AAAA;AAAA4C,EAAA,GAF1BrC,wBAAwB;AA0F9B,eAAeA,wBAAwB;AAAC,IAAAqC,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
